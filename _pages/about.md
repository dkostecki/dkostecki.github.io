PhD
======
I am a Computer Science PhD student advised by Dr. Cristina Nita-Rotaru at the [Network and Distributed Systems Security Lab (NDS2)](https://nds2.ccs.neu.edu/ "NDS2 Lab Homepage") at Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts. 

My interests lie broadly in the security of Computer Systems and Networks. Some of the work I currently contribute to involves using Software Defined Networking (SDN) as a means of security.
